# smartcab

Robert Crowe, September 2016

An implementation of reinforcement learning using Q-learning to teach a smart cab 
to drive.

This was done as a project in the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree, as a final
project in the reinforcement learning unit.  The project is implemented in Python
using Scikit-Learn (sklearn).

Starting with a model that makes random choices and receives rewards and penalties
based on the scenario rules, the model is analysed and improved as Q-learning is
implemented, the state-action pairs are defined, and hyperparameters are adjusted.
The implementation goes through four different versions of stepwise refinement.

In the final version the smartcab is successful in 99% of attempts.
